HOW TO CREATE (AND APPLY) A PATCH
=================================

Creating a patch is easy!

1. Make sure you have two CLEAN copies of the directory that you want to patch, e.g. libbluray.orig/ and libbluray.new/

2. Make your changes in libbluray.new/ (make sure that you ONLY make changes that you want to be included in the patch)

3. Create the patch from the parent directory as follows:

	diff -rupN libbluray.orig/ libbluray.new/ > libbluray.patch

4. You now have a patch called 'libbluray.patch'.

5. To apply the patch, change to the clean source directory that you want to patch (e.g. libbluray.clean/), and run:

	patch -p1 < libbluray.patch
